The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost across all arcs.  The constraints are flow conservation constraints.  The first two constraints state that the outflow from each supply node should be less than or equal to the supply capacity.  The next three constraints state that the inflow into each demand node should equal the demand at that node.

The critical path is the longest path in the network.  It represents the minimum completion time of the project, and if any task on the critical path is delayed, the entire project will be delayed.  \n\nTasks that do not lie on the critical path may be delayed to some extent without impacting the final completion date of the project.  The critical path will change if a non-critical task is delayed to a point where it becomes critical. \n\nFor example, consider a kitchen remodeling project where the home owners are remodeling their kitchen with the eventual goal of hosting a party.  Some of the tasks can be done simultaneously, such as plumbing and electricity, while others can only be started once a previous task is complete, for example the sink can only be installed once the plumbing is complete.  The critical path will indicate the minimum time for completing this project, so that they know when they can have their party.  \n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_13.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\nHere, the arcs show the task durations, while the nodes show the task start times.  For modeling purposes, let t(i) be the start time of the tasks originating at node i.  The objective is to minimize the project completion time, namely t7.  The constraints indicate the task duration and precedence.  For example, the third constraint indicates that the minimum time between starting the sink installation (that is, node 3), and starting the plumbing (that is, node 1) is 3 days.  Arcs 3-2 and 4-2 are dummy tasks required to complete the model.  Such dummy tasks have no minimum time associated with them, but are used to model precedence involving more than one preceding tasks of varying duration, in this case that the plumbing, electricity, and appliance order time must be complete before appliances can be installed. \n\nIn this graph, it\u2019s easy to see that the critical path lies on nodes 0 \u2013 2 \u2013 6 \u2013 7, with a total length of 19 days.

Examples of industries where nonlinear optimization problems are often encountered are:\nThe chemical process industry, for example oil refining or pipeline design\nThe finance sector, for example stock portfolio optimization\n\n- Nonlinear Programming (NLP) is often used to solve such optimization problems. One of the NLP techniques available through DOcplex is Quadratic Programming (QP), used especially for portfolio optimization. \n\n- Sometimes it is possible to approximate a nonlinear function with a set of linear functions and then solve the problem using LP techniques. The success of this depends on whether the nonlinear function is convex or nonconvex. \n\n## Convexity\n\nA region of the space is _convex_ if any point lying on a straight line between any two points in the region is also in the region.\n\nAll LPs are convex, because an LP involves the minimization of a linear function over a feasible region defined by a set of linear functions, and linear functions are convex.\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_19.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\n## Approximating a non-linear program with piecewise-linear functions\n\nA convex nonlinear function can be approximated by a set of linear functions, as shown in the next figure. This could be used to allow solution with LP techniques.  \n\nSuch an approximate function consisting of several linear line segments is called a _piecewise linear_ function. \n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_21.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\nWe will start by discussing this approximation.\n\nPiecewise linear programming is used when dealing with functions consisting of several linear segments. Examples of where this might be appropriate are piecewise linear approximations of convex nonlinear functions, and piecewise linear functions representing economies of scale (for example a unit cost that changes when a certain number of units are ordered.) \n\n## An example of piecewise linear programming: economies of scale\n\n\nConsider a transportation problem in which the transportation cost between an origin,$i$, and a destination, $j$, depends on the size of the shipment, $ship_{ij}$:\n- The first 1000 items have a shipping cost of \\$0.40 per item\n- For the next 2000 items (i.e. items 1001-3000) the cost is \\$ 0.20 per item\n- From item 3001 on, the cost decreases to \\$ 0.10 per item.\n\nThe cost of each quantity bracket remains intact (that is, the cost per unit changes only for additional units, and remains unchanged for the previous quantity bracket). \n\nWithin each bracket there is a linear relationship between cost and quantity, but at each breakpoint the rate of linear variation changes. \n\nIf you graph this function, you see that at each breakpoint, the slope of the line changes. The section of the graph between two breakpoints is a linear piece.\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_25.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\nThe diagram shows that the total shipping cost is evaluated by 3 different linear functions, each determined by the quantity shipped $Q$:\n\n- 0.40 * items when $Q \\le 1000$,\n- 0.40 * 1000 + 0.20 * (Q - 1000) when $1000 <= Q = 3000$,\n- 0.40 * 1000 + 0.20 * 2000 + 0.10 * (Q - 3000) when $Q \\ge 3000$.\n\nThis is an example of a piecewise linear function. Note that this function is _continuous_, that is has no 'jump' in its values, but this not mandatory for piecewise linear functions.\n\n### Piecewise linear functions with DOcplex\n\nDOcplex lets you define piecewise linear functions in two styles: either with a set of points, or with a set of values and slopes. As the problem is formulated with slopes, we'll start with this formulation.\n\nThe `Model.piecewise_with_slopes` method takes a sequence of $(x_{i}, slope_{i})$ values where $slope_{i}$ is the slope of the function between $x_{i-1}$ and $x_{i}$.",

It usually does not make sense to use a continuous variable to represent the number of airplanes to produce, because there is no point in manufacturing a partial airplane, and each finished airplane involves a large cost.  \n\n- Another example of where one would use integer variables is to model a particular state, such as on or off. For example, a unit commitment problem where integer variables are used to represent the state of a particular unit being either on or off.  \n\n- Planning of investments also requires integer variables, for example a variable that takes a value of 1 to invest in a warehouse, and 0 to ignore it.  \n\nFinally, integer variables are often used to model logic between different decision, for example that a given tax break is only applicable if a certain investment is made.\n\n## Different types of integer decisions\n\nMany types of decisions can be modeled by using integer variables. \n\nOne example is yes/no decisions, with a value of 1 for yes, and 0 for no. For example, if x equals 1, new manufacturing equipment should be installed, and if x equals 0, it should not. \n\nInteger variables are also used to model state or mode decisions. For example, if z1 equals 1 the machine operates in mode 1, if z2 equals 1, the machine operates in mode 2, and if z3 equals 1 the machine operates in mode 3.  The same integer is often used to express both yes/no decisions and logic. For example, y1 equals 1 could in this case also be used to indicate that machine 1 is installed, and 0 otherwise. \n\nFinally, integer variables are used tomodel cases where a value can take only integer values: for example: how many flights should a company operate between two airports.\n\n## Types of integer variables\n\nIn general, integer variables can take any integer value, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, and so forth.  Integers that should only take the values of 1 or 0 are known as binary (or Boolean) variables. Binary variables are also often referred to as Boolean variables because the Boolean values of true and false are analogous to 1 and 0. \n\nTo ensure that an integer variable can only take the values 0 and 1, one can give it an upper bound of 1 or declare it to be of type binary. In a DOcplex  model, decision variables are assumed to be nonnegative unless otherwise specified and the lower bound of 0 does not need to be declared explicitly. ",

Here are a few examples of\nsuch constraints.\n\n### Indicator variables\n\nIndicator variables are binary variables used to indicate whether a certain set of conditions is valid (with the variable equal to 1) or not (with the variable equal to 0). For example, consider a production problem where you want to distinguish between two states, namely production above a minimum threshold, and no production. \n\nTo model this, define a binary variable $y$ to take a value of 1 if the production is above the minimum threshold (called minProd), and 0 if there is no production. Assume $production$ is a continuous variable containing the produced quantity. \nThis leads to these two constraints.\n\n$$\nproduction \\ge minProd * y\\\\\nproduction \\le maxProd * y\n$$\n\nHere, maxProd is an upper bound on the production quantity. Thus, if y = 1, the minimum and maximum production bounds hold, and if y = 0, the production is set to zero. \n\n\n### Logical constraints - an example\n\nFor example, consider an investment decision involving a production plant and two warehouses. \n\n- If the production plant is invested in, then either warehouse 1 or warehouse 2 may be invested in (not both).\n\n- If the production plant is not invested in, then neither of the two warehouses may be invested in.\n\nLet $yPlant$ be 1 if you decide to invest in the production plant, and 0 otherwise. \nSimilar for $yWarehouse1$ and $yWarehouse2$.\nThen this example can be modeled as follows:\n\n$$\nyWarehouse1 + yWarehouse2 <= yPlant\n$$\n\nIf $yPlant$ is 0 then both $yWarehouse1$ and $yWarehouse2$ are set to zero. \n\nOn the opposite, if one warehouse variable is set to 1, then $yPlant$ is also set to 1. Finally, this constraint also states that warehouse variables cannot be both equal to 1.\n",

If not, the algorithm begins a tree search.  You\u2019ll now see an example of this tree search. \n\nConsider this integer programming problem, involving an objective to maximize, three constraints, and three non-negative integer variables (this is the default for DOcplex variables).\n\n$\nmaximize\\ x + y + 2 z\\\\\nsubject\\ to: 7x + 2y + 3z <= 36\\\\\n\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 5x + 4y + 7z <= 42\\\\\n\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 2x + 3y + 5z <= 28\\\\\n\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ x,y,z \\ge 0\n$\n\n### Branch and Bound: the root node\n\nThe first node of the branch and bound tree is the LP relaxation of the original IP model.  \nLP relaxation means that the integer variables have been relaxed to be continuous variables.  \nThe solution to the LP relaxation of a maximization IP, such as this, provides an upper bound to the original problem, in this case that bound is eleven and five elevenths.  \nThe current lower bound is minus infinity. \n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_43.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\nIn this case, the solution is fractional and the tree search continues in order to try and find an integer solution.\n\n### Branch and Bound: branching on a variable\n\nThe algorithm next chooses one of the variables to branch on, in this case $x$, and adds two constraints to create two subproblems.  \nThese two constraints are based on the relaxed value of x, namely one and three elevenths.  In the one subproblem, $x$ is required to be less than or equal to one, and in the other problem, $x$ is required to be greater than or equal to two, in order to eliminate the fractional solution found.  \nIP2 gives another fractional solution, but IP3 gives an integer solution.  This integer solution of 10 is the new lower bound to the original maximization problem, because it is the best current solution to the maximization problem.  \n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_44.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\nThe algorithm will terminate when the gap between the upper and lower bounds is sufficiently small, but at this point there is still more of the tree to explore.\n\n### Branch and Bound: iteration\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_45.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\nTwo new subproblems are now generated from IP2, and these constraints are determined by the fractional value of z in IP2.  In IP4, z must be less than or equal to 5, and in IP3 z must be greater than or equal to 6. IP4 gives another fractional solution, while IP3 is infeasible and can be pruned.  When a node is pruned, the node is not explored further in the tree.\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_46.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\nNext, two more subproblems are created from IP4, namely one with y less than or equal to zero in IP6, and one with y greater than or equal to 1 in IP5.  IP6 yields an integer solution of 11, which is an improvement of the previously found lower bound of 10. IP5 gives a fractional solution and can be explored further.\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_47.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\nSo another two subproblems are created from IP5, namely IP8 with z less than or equal to 4, and IP7 with z greater than or equal to 5.  However, the constraint added for IP4 specifies that z must be less than or equal to 5, so node IP7 immediately yields an integer solution with an objective value of 11, which is the same objective as for IP6.  IP8 yields an integer solution with objective value of 9, which is a worse solution than those previously found and IP8 can therefore be discarded.  \n\nThe optimal solution reported is the integer solution with the best objective value that was found first, namely the solution to IP6.",

The objective function of a QCP may be quadratic or linear.  \nA simple formulation of a QP is:\n\n$$\n\t{minimize}\\ \\frac{1}{2}{x^{t}Qx + c^{t}x}\\\\ \nsubject\\ to \\\\\n\\ \\ \tAx \\ge b \\\\\n\\ \\ \tlb \\le x \\le ub \\\\\n$$\n\nThe first objective term is quadratic, with Q being the matrix of objective function coefficients of the quadratic terms.  The second term and the constraints are linear. CPLEX Optimizer can solve convex QP and QCP problems. Quadratic programming is used in several real-world situations, for example portfolio management or chemical process modeling. In the next two slides, you\u2019ll see how QP applies to portfolio management. \n\nA model that has quadratic functions in the constraints is a Quadratically Constrained Program (QCP). The objective function of a QCP problem may be quadratic or linear. ",

            "source": "## Portfolio management\n\nIn order to mitigate risk while ensuring a reasonable level of return, investors purchase a variety of securities and combine these into an investment portfolio. Each security has an expected return and an associated level of risk (or variance). \n\nSecurities sometimes covary, that is, they change together with some classes of securities, and in the opposite direction of other classes of securities. An example of positive covariance is when shares in technology companies follow similar patterns of increases and decreases in value. On the other hand, as the price of oil rises, shares in oil companies may increase in value, but plastics manufacturers, who depend on petroleum as a major primary resource, may see their shares decline in value as their costs go up and vice versa. This is negative covariance. \n\nTo optimize a portfolio in terms of risk and return, an investor will evaluate the sum of expected returns of the securities, the total variances of the securities, and the covariances of the securities.  A portfolio that contains a large number of positively covariant securities is more risky (and potentially more rewarding) than one that contains a mix of positively and negatively covariant securities. \n\n### Potfolio optimization: what use?\n\nPortfolio optimization is used to select securities to maximize the rate of return, while managing the volatility of the portfolio and remaining within the investment budget. \n\nAs the securities covary with one another, selecting the right mix of securities can change or even reduce the volatility of the portfolio with the same expected return. \n\nAt a given expected rate of return, there is one portfolio which has the lowest risk. If you plot each lowest-risk portfolio for each expected rate of return, the result is a convex graph, called the efficient frontier. \n\nThe risk-return characteristics of a portfolio change in a nonlinear fashion, and quadratic expressions are used to model them.",
